# Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) Project

This project implements **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)** using **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** to analyze and assign semantic roles to words or phrases in sentences, addressing the "who did what to whom" structure. The project involves exploring datasets, selecting meaningful features, and designing models for sequence labeling tasks. A key focus is on analyzing the impact of various features on predictive outcomes and optimizing the model through hyperparameter tuning to achieve high performance, evaluated using metrics such as the Macro F1-Score.

The methodology includes preprocessing the data, extracting syntactic and semantic features, and training CRF models to effectively capture the relationships within the input text. Thorough documentation is provided to explain the chosen inference methods, including a comparative analysis of their advantages and limitations. Additionally, results are analyzed to highlight the significance of selected features, error patterns, and the generalization capability of the models.

This project demonstrates the practical application of CRF models to semantic analysis tasks. Key deliverables include feature engineering insights and a detailed evaluation of model performance.
